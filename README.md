# Gameboy Assembly Experiments
So, I've been meaning to work on Gameboy's Assembly for quite some time now, and I finally found the opportunity; a [Spanish tutorial](https://gb-archive.github.io/salvage/tutorial_de_ensamblador/tutorial_de_ensamblador%20%5BLa%20decadence%5D.html) that had been neatly put up.
Using the guy's gbhw.inc, I've managed to print my first 256-tile bitmap onto the display and it kind of looks aesthetic, I'm proud of it.
This is just my first attempt at targetting the platform, so the code might be weird from a perspective of an experienced Assembly programmer, but hey, it's a bodge that works.
